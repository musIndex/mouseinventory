	<dt><b>Who has access to the UCSF mouse inventory database?</b></dt>

	<dd>Anyone who is on a computer at UCSF or who has a UCSF VPN
	account can access the database. There are no special logins or
	passwords.
	<br><br>
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Are investigators required to list all the mice in their colonies?</b></dt>

	<dd>The goal is for the database to provide a list of all the mutant allele and 
	transgenic mice, as well as inbred strains, that are being maintained at UCSF. 
	However, there is no official requirement that a particular mouse be listed, and 
	the decision as to whether to list it is up to the investigator.
	<br><br>
	In making this decision, the value to the community of providing information 
	that would prevent the importation of a mouse that is already at UCSF should be taken 
	into consideration,  as well as the value of having precise details about the mutant 
	allele, transgene, or inbred strain available to all users, including members of the 
	laboratory that is keeping the mouse.
	<br><br>
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>Does listing a mouse in the database obligate an investigator to provide it to 
	other investigators at UCSF?</b>
	</dt>

	<dd>Although UCSF has a policy and strong tradition of sharing resources, 
	submitting a mouse to the Inventory does not obligate an investigator to provide that 
	mouse to other investigators.
	<br><br>
	</dd>
	

	<dt><b>Should unpublished mice be entered?</b></dt>

	<dd>If you have a mouse that was obtained from investigators at
	another institution or one that has been generated at UCSF but it has
	not yet been published, you are welcome to enter it into the database.
	However, it is best not to enter a mouse until it is relatively
	well-characterized (e.g. do not enter G<sub>0</sub> transgenics). 
	<br><br>
	Since the database is private, there should be no issue of 'prior
	publication' when it comes to submitting a manuscript about the
	mouse to a journal; telling people at UCSF that the mouse exists could
	save other investigators time and money and stimulate collaboration.
	Describing the mouse in the database does not obligate anyone to
	provide the mouse to other investigators.
	<br><br>
	</dd>
	
	<dt><b>If a mouse was originally obtained pursuant to a material transfer agreement (MTA), 
	or if a mouse was produced at UCSF using materials obtained pusuant to an MTA, can the mouse 
	(or its descendants) be passed to another investigator at UCSF without completing a new MTA?</b>
	</dt>

	<dd>It depends on the terms and conditions of the original MTA.  In most instances, 
	the MTA will not allow such transfer within UCSF.  Contact the  
	<a href="http://industry.ucsf.edu/icd/home/contact.html">Industry Contracts Division</a>
	to determine the use and transfer restrictions 	applicable to a particular mouse (whenever possible, 
	include the name of the UCSF investigator 	who originally obtained the mouse, the name of the 
	providing institution, and the name of the mouse).
	<br><br>
	<b>It is the responsibility of the investigator who will be providing the mouse to determine if 
	an MTA must be completed before arranging for the mouse to be transferred to the recipient's colony.</b>
	<br><br>
	If ICD determines that a new MTA is required, then the next step is for the prospective recipient 
	to contact the original provider and get permission to obtain the mouse; it would be appropriate at 
	that point to ask if they would allow transfer without completing a new MTA. (In some cases the original 
	provider has agreed to allow internal distribution so long as appropriate reference is included in 
	any publication that describes use of the mouse. Such modification to the terms of the contract is at 
	the discretion of the original provider.) If such permission is granted, please contact 
	Industry Contracts Division for assistance at <a href="mailto:mta@ucsf.edu">mta@ucsf.edu</a>.  
	If a new MTA does need to be completed, please fill in a 
	<a href="http://industry.ucsf.edu/icd/home/faculty/agreements.html#dsy4917-DSY_MTA">
	UCSF Material Transfer Request Form</a>  to obtain appropriate UCSF review and signature.
	<br><br>
	In some cases, even if a new MTA is required, the original provider may offer permission for the 
	mouse to be transferred to the new holder before the MTA paperwork is completed. In other cases, s/he 
	may not. Please respect the wishes of that person with regard to this issue.
